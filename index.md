I am a PhD student at the University of Washignton studying Natural Language Processing. I am fortunate to be a member of [Noah Smith's Ark](https://noahs-ark.github.io/) and a student of the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. Before, I was an undergraduate student at Cornell University.

Right now, I'm interested in how people communicate might change over time, especially with current large, pretrained language models.
