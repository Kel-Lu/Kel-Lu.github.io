### About Me

I am currently a Research Engineer at Duolingo! I'm working on exciting work to help personalize learner experiences.

Formally, I was a PhD student at the University of Washignton studying Natural Language Processing. I was fortunate to be a member of [Noah Smith's Ark](https://noahs-ark.github.io/) and a student of the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. Before, I was an undergraduate student at Cornell University.
